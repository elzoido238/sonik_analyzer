Analysis package for SONIK experiments at TRIUMF.

Typing "make" compiles a shared library libSonik.so in lib. This library can be loaded every time a root
session is run by adding the following lines to your rootlogon.C script:

  if(!TClass::GetClass("SonikFit"))
    gSystem->Load("${SONIKSYS}/lib/libSonik.so");

where ${SONIKSYS} is defined in your .bash_profile and/or .bashrc as the directory where you installed the
sonik_analyzer package (likely ~/packages/sonik/analyzer). It is probably also a good idea to add the
following lines in order to use the sonik classes in one's own scripts:

  gInterpreter->AddIncludePath(gSystem->ExpandPathName("${SONIKSYS}/include/"));
  gInterpreter->AddIncludePath(gSystem->ExpandPathName("${SONIKSYS}/lib/"));
