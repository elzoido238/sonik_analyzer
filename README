Analysis package for SONIK experiments at TRIUMF. Requires ROOT (https://root.cern.ch) and the
DRAGON analyzer package (https://github.com/dragontriumf/analyzer).

After cloning the repository, cd to sonik_analyzer and type "make." This compiles a shared library
libSonik.so in lib. This library can be loaded every time a root session is run by adding the following
lines to your rootlogon.C script:

  if(!TClass::GetClass("SonikFit"))
    gSystem->Load("${SONIKSYS}/lib/libSonik.so");

where ${SONIKSYS} is defined in your .bash_profile and/or .bashrc as the directory where you installed the
sonik_analyzer package (likely ~/packages/sonik_analyzer). If you don't already have a rootlogon.C script,
see https://root.cern.ch/root/html534/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html#environment-setup. It is
probably also a good idea to add the following lines in order to use the sonik classes in one's own scripts:

  gInterpreter->AddIncludePath(gSystem->ExpandPathName("${SONIKSYS}/include/"));
  gInterpreter->AddIncludePath(gSystem->ExpandPathName("${SONIKSYS}/lib/"));
