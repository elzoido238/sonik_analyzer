Analysis package for SONIK experiments at TRIUMF.

Typing "make" compiles a shared library libSonik.so in lib. This library can be loaded every time a
root session is run by adding the following lines to your rootlogon.C script:

  if(!TClass::GetClass("SonikFit"))
    gSystem->Load("${SONIKSYS}/lib/libSonik.so");

It is probably a good idea to also add the following lines in oreder to use SONIK classes in one's own
scripts:

  gInterpreter->AddIncludePath(gSystem->ExpandPathName("${SONIKSYS}/include/"));
  gInterpreter->AddIncludePath(gSystem->ExpandPathName("${SONIKSYS}/lib/"));
